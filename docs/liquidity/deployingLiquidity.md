# How do I earn fees and what is the active bin?
The active bin is the currently live market price of the assets in a Liquidity Pool. Only the active bin consists of both tokens and only the active bin earns trading fees. Therefore when providing liquidity, it is important to always have Liquidity inside the active bin to ensure trading fees are being accrued. Once the price moves to a different bin, the previous active bin becomes inactive and stops acquiring fees.

# How do I rebalance?
To continue to receive trading fees, liquidity providers need to rebalance their liquidity if their liquidity moves out of the active range. This is done by removing tokens from inactive bins and depositing into the current active bins that represent the assets' current market price. Liquidity Book makes this process easy, by giving you the option to either add to your existing position or to withdraw and redeploy some or all of your liquidity.

## What are some considerations when re-balancing?
- Costs: Rebalancing involves paying for gas and buying and selling assets, which can incur trading fees. It can be helpful to consider these costs when deciding how frequently to rebalance.


- Market conditions: Rebalancing on Liquidity Book should take into account market conditions, as different market conditions may require different rebalancing strategies. For example, in a volatile market, an LP may need to rebalance more frequently.

# Removing Liquidity
There are Four options to remove Liquidity

To remove liquidity, simply select Remove Liquidity on the Pool page that you have supplied into. You will then have three options you select, simply select one of these and then define how much liquidity you would like to remove (or select Remove all).
To remove tokens from specific bins, simply enter the price points that you wish to remove tokens from. This feature gives you extra liquidity for managing your position, you may find this useful if you plan to rebalance your existing liquidity position.

### Risks when managing liquidity
Engaging in providing Liquidity using the Liquidity Book protocol involves risks, including but not limited to impermanent loss, smart contract vulnerabilities, systemic failures, liquidity crunches, regulatory changes, market volatility, and operational errors. Your capital is at risk; only invest funds you can afford to lose. No assurance or guarantee is provided, and LPs assume all responsibility for their investments. Seek independent financial advice as needed.
