## What exactly is a Liquidity Shape?
You may be curious about what constitutes a liquidity shape. Typically, when you deposit your liquidity into a pool, you distribute your tokens across selected price points. However, the Liquidity Book is distinct in that it allows you to construct varying shapes by allocating different amounts of tokens at diverse price points that are referred to as bins. Each bin represents a fixed price pool in a Liquidity Pool and when you deploy your Liquidity, you will be defining your range by selecting bins. This concept is known as building a liquidity shape.
Custom liquidity shapes allow liquidity providers to tailor strategies to their risk preferences, market outlook, and time horizons. There is no right or wrong liquidity shape – each one will perform the best depending on your own management of your position and also market conditions.
Below is a high-level Liquidity Shapes, each specific bar you see in the liquidity shape is one bin and each bin represents a fixed price point. The below image outlines the three core shapes you can deploy, with an overview detailing the key use case of each shape.

Please note that providing concentrated liquidity can come with a large risk of impermanent loss if a position is not monitored closely. No strategy deployed will prevent the possibility of imminent loss. You must monitor your position.

## Earning Fees: The Active Bin
The main aim for any Liquidity Provider is to earn fees captured by the trading activity that occurs in a Liquidity Pool. To earn fees using the Liquidity Book, your liquidity must be within range. If your liquidity is in range, you will see the active bin which is visualized on the UI as being split by two colors, see the image below for further clarity on how the active bin will appear on the UI.
To enhance your earning potential, you are expected to manage your liquidity, keeping it balanced and within range. Liquidity Shapes and the strategies you deploy and how you go about managing your liquidity, are all key to how you earn fees.

The guide below is split between Basic and Advanced strategies.
Basic strategies: The most suited for users who are just getting familiar with concentrated liquidity, is the Liquidity Book and its bin architecture. They can be deployed in one click using Trader Joe’s interface and don’t require any advanced knowledge.
Advanced strategies: Combine two or more basic shapes to achieve even more granular control over liquidity. They are more difficult to deploy and carry greater risks but can yield better rewards.
Single-side strategies: By deploying just one side of the market, you can execute entry/exit to a specific token on the other side of the market. Utilizing the different shapes available will further enhance your efficiency in how you enter/exit a token.
