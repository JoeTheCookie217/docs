# Dusa v2

Dusa v2 adopts a **ve(3,3)** design. Liquidity Providers (LPs) earn **$DUSA emissions**, while voters who lock $DUSA into **$veDUSA** direct where emissions go and receive **100% of protocol trading fees** plus any voter incentives (“bribes”).

## TL;DR

- **Epoch** = 7 days.
- **LPs** earn: $DUSA emissions (not swap fees).
- **Voters (veDUSA)** earn: 100% of prior-epoch trading fees + any incentives for the pools they vote for.
- **Votes** determine the **next epoch’s** emission split across pools.

---

## How an epoch works

1. **Vote** — $veDUSA holders vote to direct the **next epoch’s** emissions across pools.  
2. **Trade** — During the current epoch, pools accrue trading fees.  
3. **Distribute (end of epoch)**  
   - **LPs:** Receive the epoch’s $DUSA emissions for their pool(s), pro-rata within each pool.  
   - **Voters:** Receive **100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch** + any **current-epoch incentives** for the pools they voted for.

> **Example timeline**  
> If you vote in **Epoch N**:  
> - Your vote sets emission weights for **Epoch N+1**.  
> - At the end of **Epoch N**, you receive:  
>   - Fees from **Epoch N-1** (protocol trading fees).  
>   - Any incentives posted for **Epoch N** on pools you voted for.

## Roles & tokens

- **$DUSA (ERC-20)** — Utility & emission token.  
- **$veDUSA (ERC-721)** — Governance/voting token represented as an NFT (“veNFT”).

Anyone can **lock $DUSA** to mint a $veDUSA NFT. You can add more $DUSA to the same veNFT at any time.

### Lock length → voting power

Lock up to **4 years**. Voting power scales linearly with lock time:

- `100 $DUSA` locked for **4 years** → `100 $veDUSA`  
- `100 $DUSA` locked for **1 year** → `25 $veDUSA`

> **Permanent max-lock option**  
> A lock (veNFT) can be set to the **maximum** (4 years) and treated as **permanently max-locked**: voting power is always counted at the max and **does not decay**.

## Emissions (for LPs)

- Weekly $DUSA distribution **starts at 39,000 $DUSA per epoch**. Governance can update this parameter.  
- Emissions are **allocated to pools by votes** (higher votes → higher share of emissions).  
- Within each pool, LPs receive a share of that pool’s emissions **pro-rata to their provided liquidity** (and pool-specific mechanics such as time in-range, where applicable).  
- **LPs do not receive swap fees.** Their rewards are $DUSA emissions only.  
- Rewards are **auto-distributable** at the end of each epoch.

> **Note**: The **$veDUSA supply** does **not** change the weekly emission total; it only affects **how** emissions are split across pools via voting.

---

## Fees & voter rewards (for veDUSA)

- **100% of protocol trading fees** are paid to **$veDUSA voters** (not LPs), based on how they voted.  
- Fees distributed at the end of an epoch correspond to the **previous epoch’s** trading activity (see timeline above).

---

## Voter incentives (“bribes”)

Anyone can attach **incentives** to a pool for a given epoch to attract votes.  
- Incentives are paid to **voters** who vote for that pool during that epoch.  
- More incentives → typically more votes → **more emissions** flowing to that pool → higher $DUSA rewards for its LPs.

---

## Key parameters (defaults)

- **Epoch length:** 7 days  
- **Initial weekly emissions:** 39,000 $DUSA (governance adjustable)  
- **Fee recipients:** 100% to veDUSA voters  
- **LP fee share:** 0% (LPs earn emissions only)  
- **Max lock length:** 4 years (option to treat as permanent max-lock with no decay)

## Glossary

- **Epoch** — Fixed 7-day cycle for votes, fees, incentives, and emissions.  
- **Emissions** — New $DUSA distributed to LPs, allocated to pools by votes.  
- **Fees** — Trading fees generated by swaps; paid 100% to voters.  
- **Incentives (Bribes)** — External rewards offered to voters for voting for a pool.  
- **$veDUSA** — Vote-escrowed $DUSA in NFT form; used for voting and earning fees/incentives.
