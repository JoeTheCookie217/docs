# Autonomous Liquidity

## Introduction

Dusa has taken the concept of concentrated liquidity a step further by introducing Autonomous Liquidity. Instead of LPs having to regularly modify their liquidity position (manually or by using bots) to follow the market price, Autonomous Liquidity uses Autonomous Smart Contracts on the Massa Blockchain to do this job at the protocol level. Autonomous Smart Contracts introduce self wake-up capabilities to smart contracts, allowing them to perform arbitrary operations when specific exchange rate targets of an pool are met.
