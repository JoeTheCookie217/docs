  1. **Pre-TGE Rewards**: Incentives for Liquidity Providers (LPs) and weekly activity-based distributions.  
  2. **Post-TGE Rewards**: Bi-annual Duser Distribution in $JELLY over five years (with 17% of $DUSA supply reserved).  
- **Pre-TGE $JELLY Allocation (Total 2.35%)**:
  - **1.5%**: For point-to-$JELLY conversion on December 23, 2024, at 6:00 PM.  
  - **0.5%**: For weekly activity-based distributions in January and February 2025.  
  - **0.35%**: Additional incentives for Liquidity Providers before TGE.  
- **17% Post-TGE Allocation**: Over five years, 17% of the total $DUSA supply will be distributed as $JELLY through the bi-annual Duser Distribution.

## What is the Jelly Token?

The Jelly Token, commonly referred to as **$JELLY**, is a non-transferable reward token designed to align user incentives with the success and longevity of the Dusa Protocol. While **$DUSA** is the primary governance token, $JELLY rewards Liquidity Providers (LPs) and active protocol users. Its non-transferability ensures only genuine participants—those who provide liquidity, trade, or otherwise contribute—benefit from its distribution. By offering structured redemption and a mix of pre- and post-TGE rewards, $JELLY encourages both immediate engagement and long-term commitment.

## The $JELLY Rewards System

The $JELLY rewards system balances short-term activity with long-term governance.

- **Before the Token Generation Event (TGE)**: $JELLY primarily boosts Liquidity Providers’ APR and serves as an additional incentive when $DUSA incentives are not yet active.  
- **After the TGE**: $JELLY transitions into a bi-annual reward model (the **Duser Distribution**), distributing tokens over a five-year period.

This two-pronged strategy ensures that early supporters are recognized while also welcoming future participants. LPs initially receive $JELLY in place of or in addition to other token incentives, and later, any address that engages with the Dusa Protocol (e.g., trading, liquidity provision) has the opportunity to accumulate $JELLY every six months. This recurring cycle of rewards ensures that both legacy and new contributions are acknowledged.

### How to Earn $JELLY

**Pre-TGE (Liquidity Provision & Points)**  
   - **December 23, 2024, at 6:00 PM**: All accumulated points from protocol activities will convert into $JELLY. This allocation uses **1.5%** of the total $DUSA supply.  
   - **Weekly Activity in January & February 2025**: An additional **0.5%** of the $DUSA supply will be distributed as $JELLY rewards, calculated weekly based on each user’s share of protocol activity.  
   - **Boosted LP Incentives**: A further **0.35%** of the total $DUSA supply is allocated to incentivize liquidity provision, enhancing APR for early Liquidity Providers.

**Post-TGE (Bi-Annual Duser Distribution)**  
   After the TGE, $JELLY becomes part of a recurring six-month reward mechanism known as the **Duser Distribution**, backed by **17%** of the total $DUSA supply. Every six months for five years, active users—those trading, providing liquidity, or otherwise participating—earn additional $JELLY. This ensures that both new and long-standing users can benefit from continued engagement.

## Distribution and Supply

The $JELLY token distribution is carefully structured around two key phases:

**Pre-TGE Allocations (2.35% of $DUSA)**  
   - **1.5%**: For converting users’ accumulated points into $JELLY on December 23, 2024, at 6:00 PM.  
   - **0.5%**: For weekly activity-based $JELLY distributions in January and February 2025.  
   - **0.35%**: Dedicated to additional LP incentives before the TGE.

**Post-TGE Duser Distribution (17% of $DUSA)**  
   After the TGE, $JELLY is distributed bi-annually over five years (the **Duser Distribution**). A total of **17%** of the $DUSA supply is reserved for this long-term reward model, ensuring that both early adopters and new participants have ample opportunity to earn $JELLY and, subsequently, convert it to $DUSA.

---

## The $JELLY Dynamic

An essential feature of $JELLY is its **redemption** into $DUSA:

**Pre-TGE Conversion (1:1 at TGE)**  
   All $JELLY accrued before the TGE is convertible at a 1:1 ratio into $DUSA. This ensures that users who contributed early are seamlessly integrated into the long-term governance structure.

**Twice-a-Year Redemptions Post-TGE**  
   Every six months following TGE, $JELLY holders can redeem their tokens for $DUSA, directly linking protocol activity to long-term governance participation. By making redemptions available bi-annually, the protocol encourages sustained engagement rather than speculative holding.

---

## $JELLY Utility and Benefits

**Bi-Annual $DUSA Redemption**  
   $JELLY can be redeemed for $DUSA twice a year post-TGE, ensuring short-term engagement feeds into long-term governance value.

**Boosted Returns for Liquidity Providers**  
   Leading up to the TGE, LPs enjoy enhanced APR through $JELLY, compensating them for their early and ongoing support of the Dusa Protocol.

**Long-Term Contributor Recognition**  
   Because $JELLY is non-transferable, only active and returning users can accumulate more over time. This direct reward model prevents speculative trading and ensures fair distribution to genuine contributors.

**Non-Transferability**  
   $JELLY cannot be traded, gifted, or sold on secondary markets. Its value is intrinsically tied to authentic protocol engagement.

## Timeline

- **December 23, 2024 (6:00 PM)**  
  Conversion of existing activity points into $JELLY using **1.5%** of the total $DUSA supply. This marks the beginning of $JELLY’s role in the reward ecosystem.

- **January & February 2025**  
  An additional **0.5%** of the total $DUSA supply is distributed as $JELLY each week based on user activity. A separate **0.35%** is allocated for boosted LP incentives.

- **TGE (Early 2025)**  
  At TGE, all pre-TGE $JELLY converts 1:1 into $DUSA. Going forward, $DUSA becomes the primary reward token for liquidity incentives, while $JELLY transitions into a bi-annual reward token distributed via the **Duser Distribution** (17% of $DUSA reserved).

## Conclusion

The Jelly Token ($JELLY) is a vital component of the Dusa Protocol’s reward ecosystem, incentivizing both early adopters and long-term community members. By combining **pre-TGE** liquidity and activity-based rewards (totaling 2.35% of $DUSA) with a **five-year, bi-annual Duser Distribution** (17% of $DUSA), $JELLY strikes a balance between short-term participation and sustained engagement. Its **non-transferable** nature ensures only true contributors can benefit, and the **1:1 conversion at TGE**, followed by **twice-a-year** redemptions, seamlessly links user activity to governance. This framework underscores Dusa’s commitment to fairness, community-driven growth, and an inclusive, long-lasting ecosystem.
